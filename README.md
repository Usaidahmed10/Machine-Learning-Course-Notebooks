# Machine Learning Course Notebooks

This repository contains Google Colab notebooks from a machine learning course, covering essential topics in regression, evaluation, and classification. Each notebook is designed to help you understand and implement fundamental concepts and techniques in machine learning.

## Table of Contents

### 1. Optimization for Regression
- **Understanding the Dataset**: An introduction to the dataset used for regression tasks.
- **Closed Form Solution**: Analytical solution to linear regression using the normal equation.
- **Batch Gradient Descent**: Iterative optimization technique for minimizing the cost function.
- **Polynomial Regression**: Extending linear regression to capture non-linear relationships.
- **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent**: A variant of gradient descent that balances batch and stochastic methods.
- **Step Sizes**: Understanding the impact of learning rates on gradient descent convergence.

### 2. Evaluating Predictors
- **Visualizing Different Errors**: Analyzing and interpreting prediction errors.
- **Picking the Best Polynomial Predictor**: Model selection using validation techniques.
- **Regularization**: Techniques like L1 and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.

### 3. Classification
- **Understanding the Dataset**: Overview of datasets used for binary and multiclass classification tasks.
- **Binary Classification**: Implementing and evaluating models for two-class problems.
- **Multiclass Classification**: Extending binary classification methods to handle multiple classes.
